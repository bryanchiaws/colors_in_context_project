# colors_in_context_project
For a Natural Language Understanding Class

Using the Colors-in-Context task from Monroe et. al. (https://doi.org/10.1162/tacl_a_00064), we develop a Transformer-based Encoder-Decoder model to generate text given a sequence of colors, allowing the listener to correctly pick out the color in the sequence the speaker was referring to.

The code can be primarily found in `project_colors.ipynb`, and the analysis is uploaded as `final_paper.pdf`
