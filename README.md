For a Natural Language Understanding Class

Using the Colors-in-Context task from Monroe et. al. (https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00064/43470/Colors-in-Context-A-Pragmatic-Neural-Model-for), we develop a Transformer-based Encoder-Decoder model to generate text given a sequence of colors, allowing the listener to correctly pick out the color in the sequence the speaker was referring to.
